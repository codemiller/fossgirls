Educating Girls About FOSS, With FOSS -- LCA Presentation

Abstract: Many believe that a key strategy for increasing the number of women in IT and open source is to educate girls about computing at
a young age. One opportunity to do so is the annual IBM EXITE (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for teenage
girls. Last year Katie ran a workshop at two Queensland camps, tackling the subject of open source using open source tools. In this
talk she will share her experiences and the lessons learnt through the two workshop sessions, as well as demonstrating some of the tools used.
